MCA/trace library as a shared object
-Investigate and add pause between sending UDP packets for poll.
-Put the firmware and set files into the ldf data stream?
-Break up aspects for different Pixie revisions into different files
-Three Phase Readout
  -Problem: Cannot read a single word from a buffer
  -Solution(?) Read two words, get size, read all but last 2, read out until the
  end.
  -% of time waiting is an indication of if we need something like this

-Short read out times can lead to chopped events in the scan, which would need
    double buffering
-Info readout of some module parameters(# traces, % time above threshold, etc.)
    is slightly different for different buffers.
-The out of range parameter can be used to find energy of saturated traces?

---- PIXIE 500 ----
Get this merged into the PixieSuite? There is a completely different API,
    this will not be trivial.
